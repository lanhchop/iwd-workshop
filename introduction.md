## How Do Browsers Work?

Web browsers are like any program that opens files. Word opens DOCX and InDesign open INDD.

Browsers open HTML files located on your PC or, more likely, on some server. HTML files can tell the browser to pull in CSS and JavaScript files which are also understood by the browser.
