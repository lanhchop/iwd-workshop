# CSS Basics

## CSS Files

```css
h1 {
  color: green;
}

.my-class {
  font-family: "Comic Sans";
}
```

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) describes the __style__ of web pages through classes. Each class declares what elements it gets applied to with its __selector__ and describes the style of that element with its __properties__.

Web browsers only open HTML files, but we can add links to CSS files in our HTML document's head. When the browser opens our HTML file, the `<link>` element tells it to pull in whatever CSS file we specify.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="my-styles.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto"> 
</head>
</html>
```
