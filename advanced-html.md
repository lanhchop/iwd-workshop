## Inputs

```html
<input type="text">
<input type="number" min="-10" max="10">
```

The `<input>` element is intended to collect some kind of input from users. After filling out an input with data, users typically see something in the page change or have a chance to submit information to a server. Oftentimes, `<input>` elements look like text boxes. Depending on the value of its `type` attribute, an `<input>` can take many different forms.

I've seen more than one professional software developer underestimate how powerful the `<input>` element can be. Understanding all of its forms can save you thousands of lines of complex code.
