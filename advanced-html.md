## Inputs

```html
<input type="text">
<input type="number" min="-10" max="10">
<input type="range">
```

The `<input>` element is intended to collect some kind of input from users. After filling out an input with data, users typically see something in the page change or have a chance to submit information to a server. Oftentimes, `<input>` elements look like text boxes, but this element can handle more complex input as well. Understanding all of the valid values for its `type` attribute can save you thousands of lines of complex code.
